# Code of Conduct

We want to make this event a welcoming environment for all attendees. To that end, we would like to remind you that all activities associated with this event are subject to AppSec New Zealand's [Policies](https://appsec.org.nz/about/policies.html). At their core, these policies are intended to promote and maintain an inclusive, welcoming environment for all participants - actions detrimental to that environment are unwelcome.

Speakers, trainers and sponsors have all been reminded of these policies, and are expected to abide by them like all attendees.

If you have any concerns during the day, please seek out one of the organisers. We will make ourselves visible at the start of the day, so you know what we look like. At any time you can reach out to John DiLeo by [email](mailto:john.dileo@appsec.org.nz), text or phone (+64 21 516 392).
