# Welcome!

_You_ are invited to join us at security.ac.nz this September for an 
amazing day of learning about security and hacking.

## Who?

You! Anyone who is learning about software, and wants to learn about
how to make software secure... with a dose of "how to hack" thrown in.

To clarify: The day will aim to suit students with a 100-level
knowledge of software development. However, you're still welcome if
you're not a University student... anyone interested in security
should come!

## What?

A day of training in the art of securing the web... covering topics
like:

- Learning to hack
- Threats & Trust
- Secure the Cloud
- Secure Development
- Web Security
- Cyber Security Careers
