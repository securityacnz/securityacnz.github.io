# Activities

Over the two days we will have a range of [speakers](speakers), as well as three activities:

- Capture the Flag
- Bug Bounty (for ECS students)
- Secure Code Warrior Tournament

## Capture the Flag

### What will you need?

A laptop with a web browser. If you aren't able to bring a laptop, let us know on the registration confirmation form.

If you've got OSX or Linux, you should have everything you need pre-installed. If you're running Windows, please install [https://pentestbox.org/](https://pentestbox.org/)

### What will we be doing?

There will be a series of activities aimed at encouraging you to try various "offensive" security techniques. You will start off gently, and the difficulty will gradually increase.

You can work individually, or in groups. This is a no-pressure, fun exercise!

## Bug Bounty

### What will you need?

To participate in the bug bounty you will need to be an ECS student at Victoria University. Please read the [Bug Bounty terms](bugbounty). If you're not an ECS student, fear not! This will be running the same time as the Capture the Flag.

You will be performing your tests from the ECS lab environment using a [Kali VM](https://www.kali.org/). If you are unfamiliar with Kali, you might want to play around with it in advance.

### What will we be doing?

The goal of the bug bounty is to perform an offensive penetration testing engagement against a real-life target. Please read the [Bug Bounty terms](bugbounty).

### Who will be running the bounty?

Hugh Davenport and the team from [ZX Security](https://zxsecurity.co.nz/) will be running the bounty in conjunction with the School of Engineering and Computer Science.

## Secure Code Warrior Tournament

### What will you need?

A laptop with a web browser, and access to your email. If you aren't able to bring a laptop, let us know on the registration confirmation form.

### What will we be doing?

The team from [Secure Code Warrior](https://securecodewarrior.com/) will be coming to New Zealand to run a secure coding tournament!

Players will be presented with a series of vulnerable code challenges that will ask them to identify the problem, locate the insecure code, and fix the vulnerability. All challenges are based on the OWASP Top 10 and they can choose from a range of software languages to compete in the tournament, including Java EE, Java Spring, C# MVC, C# WebForms, Ruby on Rails, Python Django, Scala Play & Node.JS.

Throughout the tournament, you will earn points and can watch as you climb to the top of the leaderboard and be crowned the ‘Secure Code Warrior.’

### Who will be running the tournament?

The team from [Secure Code Warrior](https://securecodewarrior.com/).
